Here the datasets for the model were collected from kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/code/ltrahul/emotion-detection-from-text/input
The whole model was built on google colab.
Here we mainly took the dataset and preprocessed them to some extent and later tokenized
everything. Glove embedding was also used.
Adam optimizer was used for better results.
It shows very good test accuracy. upto 90%.
